public class DesignPattern {
    /*
     A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
     Design patterns are not specific implementations or code snippets, but rather conceptual templates that can be applied to
     solve particular design problems.

    Here are some key points about design patterns in Java:

    Reliability: Design patterns encapsulate solutions to recurring design problems and provide a blueprint for creating reusable software
    components.

    Abstraction: They abstract the solution from the implementation details, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.

    Best Practices: Design patterns encapsulate best practices and proven techniques for solving common software design problems.

    Classification: Design patterns are typically classified into three main categories: creation patterns, structural patterns, and
    behavioral patterns. Creation patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, structural patterns deal with object composition
     and structure, and behavioral patterns deal with object collaboration and responsibility.

    Language Agnostic: Design patterns are not tied to a specific programming language. They can be applied in various programming
    languages, including Java, C++, Python, and others.

    Examples: Some commonly used design patterns in Java include Singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Adapter, Observer, Strategy, and many
    more.
